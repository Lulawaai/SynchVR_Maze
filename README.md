# SynchVR_Maze

A maze is an adventurous game that can be built in a modular way and allows customization of themes, obstacles, power-ups...

I have chosen probuilder because it allows quick prototyping. The props are coming from https://filebase.gamedevhq.com/

The goal of this Maze is to collect gems, find the key, and the exit.

Once the project has been downloaded:

- Go to the project window and open up: IntroScene
- Controls:
Moving - WASD and ARROWs 
Jump - Space
